# WSPR-ease Project Overview

**WSPR-ease** is a standalone, precision Multiband WSPR beacon
covering the 80m through 10m Amateur Radio bands (3.5 MHz – 29.7 MHz).

It utilizes a hybrid **ESP32-S3 + FPGA** architecture to synthesize
high-purity RF signals using a **6-Step "1-2-1" Harmonic
Cancellation** sequence. This approach eliminates the 3rd harmonic
digitally, allowing for a simplified Low Pass Filter (LPF) design
while maintaining atomic timing accuracy via GNSS discipline.

---

## System Architecture

The system operates as a **Software Defined Transmitter**. The ESP32
calculates the WSPR symbols and frequency, while the FPGA generates
the stepped RF waveform in real-time.

        waveform.

        (3rd harmonic cancelled).

## RF Power Amplifier

### Topology

A Low-Side Tapped Transformer driver (Class D/E variant) optimized for
5V operation.

*   **Driver:** 74ACT244 (running at 5V).
*   **PA:** 4 Groups of 3x Parallel BS170.
*   **Transformer:** BN-43-202 Binocular Core.
    *   **Primary:** 4 Turns Center Tapped (Tap at 2 Turns).
    *   **Secondary:** 4 Turns.
    *   **Note:** The 4-turn primary provides $\sim 35\mu H$
        inductance ($X_L \approx 770\Omega @ 3.5 MHz$), ensuring
        efficient operation down to the 80m band without saturation.

### Protection Circuitry (Critical)

*   **Flyback Diodes:** 1N5817 Schottky diodes in series with the
    Drains of the Push 1 and Pull 1 MOSFET groups. This blocks reverse
    current during the negative half of the "1-2-1" cycle.
*   **Gate Resistors:** 10Ω series resistors on all Gate lines to
    dampen parasitic oscillation (ringing) which can occur due to the
    fast edges of the 74ACT244.

### Power Output Variability

There is a very elegant digital method to reduce power within the FPGA
without changing the transformer, VBUS voltage, or "1-2-1" harmonic
cancellation logic.

Since we use an NCO-based sequencer to drive the 74ACT541 buffers, the
simplest method is **Pulse Width Control (Duty Cycle Modulation)** at
the sequence level.

#### The "Gap" Method (Zero-State Insertion)
Currently, the 6-step sequence likely transitions immediately from one
state to the next (e.g., Push Peak $\rightarrow$ Push Base
$\rightarrow$ Push Peak). To reduce power, insert a "Dead Time" or
"High-Z" state between every transition.

Instead of a continuous drive, modify the FPGA logic to:
1. Drive the FET for a portion of the 60° window.
2. Turn **OFF** all FETs for the remainder of that window.

Because the 74ACT541 has an **Output Enable (nOE)** pin, or simply
drive all four gate signals (`paPushPeak`, `paPushBase`, etc.) to
**0** in Verilog, to effectively "chop" the waveform.


### Implementation: The 2nd Accumulator
Add a small "Power Register" (e.g., 8-bit) that acts as a threshold.
* The main NCO determines the **frequency** (the 6-step cycle).
* A second, faster counter (or a sub-division of the system clock)
  determines the **duration** of the "On" time within each of those 6
  steps.

**Mathematical Result:** Reduce the "On" time of each step by 50% to
drop the $V_{RMS}$ of the secondary waveform. Since $P = V^2 / R$, the
power drops quadratically.
* **100% Duty:** 1.5W
* **70% Duty:** ~0.73W
* **50% Duty:** ~0.37W

### Why this is better than "Skipping Cycles"
Some digital PAs use "Pulse Density Modulation" (skipping whole RF
cycles). WSPR-ease does not do this. Skipping cycles creates massive
sub-harmonic spurs that will fail FCC/Off-air purity requirements.

By narrowing the individual steps within the "1-2-1" sequence:
1. Maintain the **fundamental frequency**.
2. The **"1-2-1" ratio** is preserved (so the 3rd harmonic
   cancellation still functions).
3. The **Low Pass Filter** sees a signal that is simply "smaller" in
   amplitude, though slightly richer in very high-order harmonics
   (which the LPF is already designed to kill).

### Code Snippet Logic (Verilog)
In the sequencer, add a `paGlobalEn` signal:

```verilog
// Simple Power Control Logic
reg [7:0] pwrCounter;
wire paGlobalEn = (pwrCounter < pwrThreshold); // pwrThreshold set by ESP32 via SPI

always @(posedge clkFast) begin
    pwrCounter <= pwrCounter + 1;
    
    // Assign gate outputs
    paPushPeak = (currentState == PUSH_PEAK) && paGlobalEn;
    paPushBase = (currentState == PUSH_BASE) && paGlobalEn;
    // ... etc
end
```

### Hardware Benefit: FET Thermals
This method is extremely efficient. Because the MOSFETs are either
"Fully ON" or "Fully OFF," they don't dissipate extra heat like a
linear regulator would. In fact, reducing power this way makes the PA
run **cooler**, as the switching losses remain low but the average
current decreases.

**Architect's Note:** Using the **nOE** pin of the 74ACT541 for this
"chopping" is the cleanest way to implement it if you want to ensure
all lines go high-impedance simultaneously, but doing it in the
gate-drive logic (as shown above) gives you more granular control
without stressing the 74ACT enable pin's timing.


## PCB Design Rules

*   **Symbol Verification:** Ensure the iCE40UP5K-SG48 symbol is used.
    (Pin 29 is VCCPLL, Pin 24 is VPP\_2V5). **Do not use LP1K
    symbols.**
*   **Decoupling:**
    *   **FPGA VCCPLL (Pin 29):** Must have 10Ω Series Resistor and
        10µF Capacitor to GND.
    *   **RF PA:** Place 22µF bulk capacitance right at the
        Transformer Center Tap.
*   **Layout:**
    *   Keep the 74ACT -> MOSFET -> Transformer loop as short as
        possible.
    *   Use Copper Pours for the MOSFET Drains (Heatsinking).
    *   Keep GNSS Antenna input traces away from the 30 MHz RF
        switching nodes.

## Firmware Operation (Zephyr)

*   **Boot:** ESP32 loads bitstream to FPGA via SPI.
*   **Band Select:** User selects Band (e.g., 20m). ESP32 sets
    `LPF_loON` + `LPF_lo2ON` HIGH.
*   **Calibration:** ESP32 measures PPS interval vs 40 MHz clock to
    determine true frequency.
*   **Transmit:** ESP32 computes NCO tuning word for target
    frequency + WSPR tone shift and updates FPGA over SPI at 1.46 Hz.

---

## Scheduling

WSPR transmission can be scheduled very flexibly. A set of ham bands
and times for those bands to be used is configurable. Once this is
done, the choice of which band to transmit on is made based on a
selection of random, round-robin, or a list of bands. This last
selection provides a mechanism to allow a band to be listed e.g., five
times in a random or round-robin list to make it five times as likely
to be chosen as the others.

For time, the UTC, user's local time zone, and/or offset from sunrise
and sunset at grid square center or GNSS lat/lon. Each sunrise/sunset
relative time needs to be evaluated at time of scheduling since it
changes daily.
